# Overview

Welcome to my Asteroids Game clone! This is an my attempt at game development, with more to come in the future. To play the game, ensure that the main.py file is open, then run this program how you normally run a python file.ã€€For me, (using VSCode) there is a play button in the top right of the screen that I press to run the program.

# Development Environment

For this program, I used python, as well as PyGame. That specific library was used for it's simplicity and ease of use.

# Future Work
Things to add:
* Graphics for invaders/player
* Ability to pause the game
* A 'home base' to protect
* More levels, that become increasingly harder.
